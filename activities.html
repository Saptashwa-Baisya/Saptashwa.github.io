  <h1>Research and Applications</h1>
  <p>This page contains reports of some of the works that I have done.</p>
  <p>
    1. SRFP 2024: I spent the summer of 2024 at IISER Pune, studying under the guidance
    of Dr. Anup Biswas. The topic of my study was "Fine Properties of Functions, with applications in Brownian Motion". 
    To understand what it means, observe that in our familiar 3 dimensional space, we naturally measure the size of an
    object by its volume. However a triangle in 3-D has Volume 0, so does a straight line segment. Does that mean we can't
    distinguish between a triangle and a line based on their size? Thinking about it, we realize we can put to use the 
    fact that the triangle has an "area", which the line does not. Further, we can 
    intuitively assign dimensions (2 and 1 respectively) to them. These notions can be rigorously formalized, which 
    constituted the initial part of my study.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, there seems to be a measure, which is not the Lebesgue measure, that measures lower 
    dimensional objects in a higher dimensional spaces and assigns appropriate dimensions to 
    them. This is called the Hausdorff Measure, and the dimension it assigns is called the 
    Hausdorff Dimension. The Hausdorff Measure captures, in some sense, sets which are invisible to the Lebesgue
    Measure, and thus it can be used to peek at properties of functions which are restricted to 
    very small sets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, think of a Brownian Path as the path traced out by a pollen grain in water. Its highly
    irregular nature made it a perfect example to apply the techniques that we learnt. Hence as 
    an application, we looked at the Hausdorff Dimension of Brownian Paths.

    You can find a report of my study 
    <a href="SRFP_Report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    During the duration of the study, I received Fellowship under the Summer Research Fellowship
    Program (SRFP), supported jointly by the Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Sciences
    Academy and The National Academy of Sciences, India (IAS-INSA-NASI).
