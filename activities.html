        1. SRFP 2024: I spent the summer of 2024 at IISER Pune, studying under the guidance
        of Dr. Anup Biswas. The topic of my study was the formalization of lower dimensional
        objects in higher dimensional spaces. For instance, we know a triangle in our 3 dimensional
        space has lebesgue measure (Volume) 0, however we have a notion of it's area, which measures
        it 'size' and let's us compare any 2 triangles.

        So, there seems to be a measure, which is not the Lebesgue measure, that measures lower 
        dimensional objects in a higher dimensional spaces and assigns appropriate dimensions to 
        them. This is called the Hausdorff Measure, and the dimension it assigns is called the 
        Hausdorff Dimension. The Hausdorff Measure captures, in some sense, sets which are invisible to the Lebesgue
        Measure, and thus it can be used to peek at properties of functions which are restricted to 
        very small sets.

        Now, think of a Brownian Path as the path traced out by a pollen grain in water. Its highly
        irregular nature made it a perfect example to apply the techniques that we learnt. Hence as 
        an application, we looked at the Hausdorff Dimension of Brownian Paths.

        During the duration of the study, I received Fellowship under the Summer Research Fellowship
        Program (SRFP), supported jointly by the Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Sciences
        Academy and The National Academy of Sciences, India (IAS-INSA-NASI).
